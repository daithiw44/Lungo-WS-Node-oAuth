Quick Example using 

1. LungoJS - http://www.lungojs.com/
2. NodeJS - http://nodejs.org/
3. Node-oAuth - https://github.com/ciaranj/node-oauth

In Order to use tyou must set up a twitter App - https://dev.twitter.com/
Fill in the Customer key and Secret into the config.js and that should do it

This is a very 'lite' example really you'd be storing user keys rather then having them authenticate against twitter everytime... thats out of scope of this example as are a few other such enhancement to make it real world usable.
